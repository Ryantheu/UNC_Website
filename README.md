# UNC_Website
Website created for ENEC Capstone 

Partnered with the Research Triangle Cleantech Cluster (RTCC) using ArcGis, html, css, and javascript to enhance a pre-existing map platform for smart city, clean technology projects, and green tech businesses. This website was created as a deliverable for an Enviroment and Ecology Capstone Project. The goal of this project was to create a webpage for the Research Triangle Cleantech Cluster group that would show off via interactive map all of the green tech projects occuring around the the Research Triangle (Raliegh, Durham, Chapel Hill) area. RTCC wanted to use this website to introduce and allure green tech businesses into coming to the Research Triangle by showing them how many green projects were occuring in the area. Our team also wrote a Research Paper to complement the website. The theme of the paper was on what makes a good green buiness hub. We wrote the paper by examing three major green business hubs around the workd and pointing out their simularities. This project occured betweeen January of 2018 and April of 2018.  

The website is broken into 5 webpages: Homepage (index), city_map, university_map, why_the_triangle, and contact.

The hompage is the portal of the overall website. It explains what the purpose of this website is, displays current events, and connects the visitor to the rest of the site.

The city_map page shows off the Triangle area and all of the local projects it contains. It also lets users find out more about any of the projects they see and sort through them as well.

The University map shows a off the green projects that are happening specifically at the Triangles 3 major universities (UNC-CH, NC State, and Duke University).

The why_the_triangle page gives a run down of what makes the Research Triangle such an optimal place to work at. It lists out the benefits of the surronding schools to show businesses the potential pool of employees they could tap into.

Finally, the contact page gives users information on how they can contact the students at UNC or the RTCC group as a whole.
